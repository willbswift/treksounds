            <p>As a Front End Developer, I have a Certificate in Web Development and Bachelor degrees in Physics and
                English, which give me the versatility to speak about and explain a wide variety of topics. </p>
            <p>I am familiar with Github, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, jQuery, JSON, Node.js, Firebase, Express,
                AJAX, MongoDB, MySQL, and React. My three years of teaching physics, algebra, and video production
                classes complement and reinforce these skills. I created my first website in 1998 and have diligently
                maintained and updated it ever since then. More recently, I’ve built a portfolio of my projects,
                including a React-based memory game. All of this has given me a firm foundation in explaining complex,
                non-intuitive processes, and organizing groups of people and technical resources to create aesthetically
                pleasing and marketable products. </p>
            <p>Good eye for detail and well organized, with a talent for predicting possible future problems. Skilled at
                explaining complex ideas and seeing things from multiple points of view. I’m a drama-free worker with
                whom everyone finds it easy to get along, and I have no problem following detailed instructions. </p>

                <p>I love stories – fantastical mind expanding stories. Stories that poke the emotions and blow the mind
                    are my favorite (so Speculative Fiction, in general and Science Fiction in detail). I like to find
                    my brain and expectations challenged and norms subverted. I love stories with mystery and
                    unexplained elements that are rationalized through the process of the protagonists grappling with
                    the problem. I enjoy a solidly structured plot but will put up with a silly one if it takes my mind
                    somewhere interesting. </p>
                <p>The exception to the ‘mind over emotion’ story seems to be stories of sacrifice for intense
                    friendship and family. I’m especially drawn to stories about found and forged families (rather than
                    biological families). Romance is obviously one such example but it tends to be the one I’m least
                    interested in. My reactions to these stories is all together much more primal and emotional, and I
                    find it much harder to explain exactly why I enjoy them. </p>
